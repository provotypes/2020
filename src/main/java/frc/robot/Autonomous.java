/*
Autonomous Tasks:

// Layer 1 : (locate and deliver X balls to some location)
# this is the objective of the game.


// Layer 2 : (locate balls, pickup balls, go to some location, deliver balls, assess situations)
# This is where probably the most work is going to go in to.


// Layer 3 : (find position of a ball, drive to ball, run intake mechanisms, run over ball, find path to drop-off point, shoot balls, locate obstacles)
# these are just calling layer-4 operations with potentially different arguments or in different orders.


// Layer 4 : (ball recognition, create motion path to point, intake mechanisms, shooting mechanisms, frequent drive train presets (forward, back, left, right))
# Most of these are already defined.
